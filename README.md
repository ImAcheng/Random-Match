# Random Match
This is a simple program which is designed to be a teaching tool.

## IMPORTANT

* To open the py file, please open this stuff in IDE.
* Now, the program includes both of the console and window version.

## Usage

* You can change to launch mode by modifying [Settings.json -> Language] in "UserData" folder.

- Explanations
  - What is Resource Packs system?
    - Well, if you didn't like the original textures, you could draw new ones and apply them to the program easily!
  - What is Advanced Settings system?
    - It means some settings that I use while developing. I think they're useful, so I put them into the program.
  - Why can't we delete the debug icon?
    - It's the last texture the program can load, which means if you ACCIDENTALLY DELETED the textures from Program Data,
    the program could load this texture. 
    If you ACCIDENTALLY DELETED this texture, too, you might not able to open the program anymore.
